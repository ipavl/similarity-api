# Introduction

Similarity API is a RESTful interface to services designed to compare sets of source code for similarity, as often used for detecting software plagiarism in education. It is intended to run alongside some form of learning management system (LMS) or submission portal as a helper service, although it is also possible to interact with it directly.

You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

# Submissions

It is expected that the sets of source code to check will already be on the server where the API resides, extracted, and structured in such a way that each set (e.g. each student's assignment) is within its own directory under a common parent. The current implementation assumes that each student's submission is its own Git repo, of which the current commit on the `master` branch is used as the submission version.

In this example, all student assignments are under a top-level "submissions" directory, with a course-assignment-student hierarchy beneath.

**Note:** Submission names cannot currently contain hyphens due to the way that results are parsed.

## Trigger Similarity Check


```shell
curl http://localhost:4910/check \
  -X POST \
  -d '{"assignmentId": "33",
       "threshold": 20,
       "studentId": "jdoe05",
       "directory": "submissions/CS110_W17/A1",
       "language": "c"}' \
  --header "Content-Type:application/json"
```

```php
<?php

$client = new GuzzleHttp\Client(['base_uri' => 'http://localhost:4910/']);
$response = $client->post('check', ['json' =>
  [
    'assignmentId' => '33',
    'threshold' => 20,
    'studentId' => 'jdoe05',
    'directory' => 'submissions/CS110_W17/A1',
    'language' => 'c',
  ]
]);
```

This endpoint signals the similarity checker to run a check using the given settings.

<aside class="notice">Similarity checks are asynchronous and results may not be immediately available upon this request completing depending on the quantity and size of submissions.</aside>

### HTTP Request

`POST http://localhost:4910/check`

### Request Body

Parameter    | Type    | Description
------------ | ------- | -----------
assignmentId | String  | A shared unique identifier for all submissions for this assignment, such as the internal assignment ID from the LMS.
threshold    | Double  | The minimum % similarity to store results for. The highest result will always be stored regardless of this value.
studentId    | String  | The name of the submission to store results for.
directory    | String  | The directory on the server to check.
language     | String  | An identifier for the source code's language. See [Language Identifiers](#language-identifiers) for details.

### Response Code

`202 Accepted`

### Response Body

The response body will contain the path to the future resource:

`/assignments/33/students/jdoe05`

## Retrieve Results for Student

```shell
curl http://localhost:4910/assignments/33/students/jdoe05
```

```php
<?php

$client = new GuzzleHttp\Client(['base_uri' => 'http://localhost:4910/']);
$response = $client->get('assignments/33/students/jdoe05');

echo $response->getBody();
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:
