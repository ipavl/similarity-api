# Language Identifiers

Some similarity checkers require the language of the source code to be specified when running a check. Since these values could vary across services, Similarity API maps a generic set of identifiers to each individual service.

The following are the currently used identifiers that should be used when making a request:

Identifier | Language
---------- | --------
c | C
cpp | C++
java | Java
